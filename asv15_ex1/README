K-edge-coloring:
In SAT terms, it means we must create boolean formulas to satisfy the coloring requirements.
We are representing our coloring using 3-variable tuples: (v1, v2, c), where (v1, v2) is the edge and c is the
chosen color.

Each edge in E (v1, v2) must have at least one color
Each edge in E (v1, v2) must have at most one color
Neighbor edges do not have the same color. Meaning: for each edge and color (v1, v2, c), there cannot be:
(v1', v2, c)
(v1, v2', c)
