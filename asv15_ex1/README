K-edge-coloring:
In SAT terms, it means we must create boolean formulas to satisfy the coloring requirements.
We are representing our coloring using 3-variable tuples: (v1, v2, c), where (v1, v2) is the edge and c is the
chosen color.

Each edge in E (v1, v2) must have at least one color
Each edge in E (v1, v2) must have at most one color
Neighbor edges do not have the same color. Meaning: for each node V and color C, the list of edges that cover
 V can have at most one of (e, c) that is TRUE.

Translation of a boolean formula for "at most one is true" requires breaking down this list to pairs, making
 sure that each pair does not have the same color
